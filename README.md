OSX Security Audit and Hardening Toolkit

HOToolkit is nothing else than yet another Security Audit Tool. 

Being an Automator app to OSX, this Toolkit contains mainly a stack of useful scripts written in bash to check the security of your system and bring more ease to setting up a well hardened OSX. 

Nonetheless this Toolkit should provide free solution to help the average person increase not only security awareness but the real security of daily use systems. Anyways, some bare sense of security awareness expected, this Toolkit will provide good help bringing your systems security from 0 near Enterprise Level in an eyeblink (well in comparison), if you wish so. 

HOToolkit trys as much as possible to make a good deal between security and convenience of your daily user experience.
